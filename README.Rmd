# Mouse Clinical Trial Tools

## Overview

`MouseTools` is an R package designed to streamline data cleaning, management, and analysis in clinical trials or other longitudinal studies. Originally developed to assist with a mouse vaccine trial dataset, this package provides general-purpose tools that can be applied to any dataset with similar challenges, such as handling inconsistent date formats, detecting numeric outliers, and summarizing datasets with multiple units of measurement.

### Why Should I Use This Package?

1. **Simplify Data Wrangling**: With functions like `date_standardizer` and `summary_table_with_conversion`, this package automates common yet tedious data cleaning tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability in your analyses.
2. **Detect and Manage Outliers**: The `outlier_detection` function helps you identify and flag outliers using robust statistical methods, making your datasets cleaner and your results more trustworthy.
3. **Generate Visual Insights**: The `plot_trend` function enables quick and informative visualizations to help you understand trends in your data.
4. **Versatile Applications**: While designed for clinical trial datasets, these functions are generalizable to various domains, including finance, public health, and social sciences.

## How to Access the Package

You can install `MouseTools` from GitHub:

```{R}
# Install the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("YourUsername/MouseTools")
```

Once installed, load the package:

``` {R}
library(MouseTools)
```

## How to Use the Package

Below are two examples demonstrating how to use the package:

**Example 1: Standardizing Dates**

Do you have inconsistent date formats? date_standardizer ensures uniformity:

``` {R}
df <- data.frame(Date = c("01/02/2020", "2020-02-03"))
cleaned_df <- date_standardizer(df, Date)
print(cleaned_df)
```

Output:
``` {R}
        Date
1 2020-01-02
2 2020-02-03
```

**Example 2: Detecting Outliers**

Identify numeric outliers with outlier_detection:

``` {R}
df <- data.frame(Values = c(1, 2, 3, 100))
outliers <- outlier_detection(df, Values)
print(outliers)
```

Output:
``` {R}
  Values
4    100
```
